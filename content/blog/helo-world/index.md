Hi Everyone!

Errr.. yeah! There will be more content on this blog, (hopefully ü•∂).

What?

I see.., you're kinda lazy..., so here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rizal__fakhri), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rizal_fakhri) & [GitHub](https://github.com/rizalfakhri).


Well, you know I code `Laravel ` a lots, So I think you will see lots of Laravel things here. Despite Laravel I do learn other things too.
Hopefully I can share it as well.

Okay, Here the things.. Let's be honest, I have very little experience on explaining IT-stuff to other peoples, Like you know
the IT-things is kinda very fast on your brain, You greatly understand it. But when it comes to explaining, it's very hard.

But I'll try my best, Promise! ‚úåÔ∏è
