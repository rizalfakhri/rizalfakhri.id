Yeah i know. Absolutely know. About what you thinking about those _clickbait_ title thing.


But.. Unfortunately it's true, and it's happening.

### Litle bytes of _us_!

Here the things, The startup that I work on is a small startup company based on Cyberjaya Malaysia.
And it's still very very small, and just recently got a good big enough tender.

So here's our chances to let the world know, know who is _us_. Yeah that's badass idea though,
but with small teams, high expectations, lack of experiences, and the most important is, _bad management_. It's a great foundation to.. Chaos.

But that's not even the worst event on our journey that has just begun since the tender.

### The real problem.

The `1.0` version of the product is actually has been on the internet for about 3 years at the time this article is published though.

It was built by our previous hero before I joining the startup. Yeah it's kinda mess.

But hell yeah! we are democracy devotee, So instead of make the main product stable, we're focusing on our client requests.

So with a piece of our _front end_ & _backend_ hero, we turni.., oh! and a page of trello board too, we're turning some notes on client meeting into precious features!
and generate some penny to back our startup petty cash.

So this is pretty much **us**:

![If Apple was democracy](https://i.redd.it/r9906uyd68kx.png)

We just keep straying away from our main product idea since then. 
Indeed, being idealist (_with bad idea_) also not good too, but it's just too much.


### The problem started!

So with our expectations & goal that we're trying to reach, we decided to build a better version of our `1.0`. So the project is started! `2.0` that's what our call it.

Like I already mentioned before, we're small teams, and lacking of _heroes_!
So our HR department start to looking new hero to join our startup and reach our goal together!

And yeah we got our hero! Thanks god! Thanks!

But we need to fly him to Malaysia and you know, do the legal stuff, stay permit, visa etc.

So while waiting legal things to finish, we do our initial meeting. 
With a whiteboard and a marker, and also a tissue since we can't find our god damn eraser. the meeting begun. 

That's not goes well though, lots of arguing, tight schedules, deciding which _stack_ we're intended to use and what architecture that we want to use to make our development pipeline smooth.

But we haven't come out with conclusion yet. The time ticking. The timeline narrowing.  We don't have that much time just for arguing _stack_.

**Thursday, 28th March 2019**, Finally our new hero are touching down on KLIA Airport! But things got mess that time,
we are expanding our office! The current office space can't sustain our goal! So we move to bigger office.

The next day. After putting down our last office stuff to new office. finally our startup heroes are doing tough meeting, discussing what technology should we use to our big goal.
so **Laravel** are choosed, and we're planning to build some microservice architecture since we assume monolithic is not an option to our goal, we all agree.

We finish the day with KFC chickens and some coke.


####  I can't join the party

My visa expired,  my existence here is a crime. So i go back home to Indonesia, what a lovely country!

Like an ordinary newcomer, our new hero doesn't have any idea what our startup doing. What we are trying to achieve. And why our goal is really matter like life and death decision.

I know this is an bad behaviour, but we expect our newcomer are learn by themselves, not depends on any existing staff. We're busy doing our own job. We even often needed a hands! So you learn it yourself kiddos!

I kinda busy that time, babysitting our one of customer and settling up a features that they requested (_part of NDA_). A "scheduled-reporting" they call it.

So really i have no time to babysit our new hero! So yeah, i can't do nothing about it. Our new hero learn by himself. I don't know if he really got it or no. Screw it! I have my own job.

**6 April 2019** I facing slight _family_ problem. That forced me to take a trip back to my hometown. It's takes a week to get settled if I'm not mistaken.

While facing my own problem, our new hero ask me to do a skype meeting. Maybe to get his understanding straight up. Alright we do skype meeting. It's turned out, he's already been starting the project, He's using **Lumen** as his first API.

So I told him our company culture, "_democracy_". Those are most likely affecting our code. So I told him to build some kind of mechanism to easily switch dependency.

Seeing him scratching his head, that doesn't even itchy, I know he was have no idea about what I'm talking about. So i made a repository to give him an example. 

Then I see an "Aha!" on his face. So I thought he was got the idea.

Alright, I thought everything goes well. But it isn't.

### The Chaos are getting started

My visa renewal doesn't finish yet. Still waiting on stage stuff. I really doesn't understand what it means by Stage A, Stage B etc.

But, Some client meetings are forcing me to come back to Malaysia. So i come to Malaysia as a visitor for several days, to get these meetings straight down. 

After the meetings stuff are settled. We do internal meeting regarding our `2.0` project. I have no idea, it suddenly using `GO` as it main language. And the project has been around 20% completed. So really can't abort it with our narrowing timeline.

Even our CEO doesn't realize that the whole project will be written on go.

Yeah it's good to have latest technology on industry are built into our system. But that's not the problem. We're kids, Have very litle of experiences.

Using `GO` where mostly of our hero doesn't familiar with, even never use it is a bad idea. Not to mention our tight timeline. Beside it performance, 
It's doesn't worth to switch to `GO`. It's also without proper discussion.

The plan that we're  carefully planned during initial meeting was just get throwed to trash by our newcomer hero. To satisfy his ego as a kiddos that he can actually write go. 

That was what i thought. And I really really hope that it's just my thought.
Unfortunately it is not. It really happen.

So, with `GO` as a main language, No other hero can help him. And with our current timeline. It was just waasting time to let our existing hero to learn `GO` or build it back from scratch.

So he has to work alone then.

Days has passing, Month has passing too. Our initial POC deployment for our tender has to start. This is crucial time, where our quality are counted.

So the whole company ended up rely on him alone.

Calls, Emails, Message are ringing every single day to our CEO's phone. Asking progress to our deployment. Not to mention the existing `1.0` client too.

It's bring chaos on our schedule,  Not to mention the bug that will come since it's a new software written by a man. So our operation team not so sure about it.

And yeah! Our new hero can't handle the pressure. And he decided to quit on his probation period.  This week will be his last week on our startup. 

It's ok to quit. Definitely ok. And that's his right to quit.

But after throwing up our carefully planned plan. And our POC Deployment is right under our nose. It's just.. what should i call it.., `pussy`?

As an adult, (_he even older than me_) I think he are absolutely know about `responsibility`. But yeah, this article is all nothing about him, so just let's not talk about that.

Alright.

The `2.0` is at `90%` right now. And our operation team are doing testing right now. Some of our new client (part of the new tender) also already use it in the production.

So far, the project goes well. Besides what I thought. The man doing a great job. "Alone".


### FUN FACT

While we agree during our meetings that we shouldn't using monolithic design to our system. Ironically the new hero use it on the `2.0`'s `GO`. That's violating our agreement.

This journey is not end yet. I'll update it.
